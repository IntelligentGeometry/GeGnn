class Octree:
  r''' Builds an octree from an input point cloud.

  Args:
    depth (int): The octree depth.
    full_depth (int): The octree layers with a depth small than
        :attr:`full_depth` are forced to be full.
    batch_size (int): The octree batch size.
    device (torch.device or str): Choose from :obj:`cpu` and :obj:`gpu`.
        (default: :obj:`cpu`)

  .. note::
    The octree data structure requires that if an octree node has children nodes,
    the number of children nodes is exactly 8, in which some of the nodes are
    empty and some nodes are non-empty. The properties of an octree, including
    :obj:`keys`, :obj:`children` and :obj:`neighs`, contain both non-empty and
    empty nodes, and other properties, including :obj:`features`, :obj:`normals`
    and :obj:`points`, contain only non-empty nodes.

  .. note::
    The point cloud must be in range :obj:`[-1, 1]`.
