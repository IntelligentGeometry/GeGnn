  r''' Gathers the neighboring features for convolutions.

  Args:
    data (torch.Tensor): The input data.
    octree (Octree): The corresponding octree.
    depth (int): The depth of current octree.
    kernel_size (str): The kernel shape, choose from :obj:`333`, :obj:`311`, 
        :obj:`131`, :obj:`113`, :obj:`222`, :obj:`331`, :obj:`133`, and
        :obj:`313`.
    stride (int): The stride of neighborhoods (:obj:`1` or :obj:`2`). If the
        stride is :obj:`2`, it always returns the neighborhood of the first
        siblings, and the number of elements of output tensor is
        :obj:`octree.nnum[depth] / 8`.
    nempty (bool): If True, only returns the neighborhoods of the non-empty
        octree nodes.
